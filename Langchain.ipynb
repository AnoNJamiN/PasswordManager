      "\t* (-2) × 4 = -8\n",
      "\t* (-2) × (-3) = 6\n",

      "\t* 6 ÷ (-3) = -2\n",
      "\t* (-6) ÷ (-3) = 2\n",

      "-5 multiplied by 9 is -45\n",
      "5 multiplied by -9 is -45\n",
      "\n",

      "The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an efficient algorithm for calculating the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence. The DFT is a mathematical operation that decomposes a function or a sequence of values into its constituent frequencies. In other words, it helps us to express a signal in the frequency domain, where we can see the individual frequencies that make up the signal.\n",

      "\n",
      "The FFT is a crucial tool in many fields, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Signal Processing**: FFT is used to analyze and manipulate signals in audio, image, and video processing, such as filtering, modulation, and demodulation.\n",
      "2. **Image Analysis**: FFT is used in image processing techniques like image filtering, de-noising, and compression.\n",
      "3. **Data Analysis**: FFT is used in data analysis, such as time series analysis, spectral analysis, and forecasting.\n",
      "4. **Telecommunications**: FFT is used in modulation and demodulation of signals in communication systems.\n",
      "5. **Scientific Computing**: FFT is used to solve partial differential equations, which are used to model various physical phenomena.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How does the FFT work?**\n",
      "\n",
      "The FFT algorithm is based on the divide-and-conquer approach, which reduces the computational complexity of the DFT from O(n^2) to O(n log n). Here's a simplified overview of the FFT algorithm:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Divide**: Divide the input sequence into smaller segments, called \"butterflies.\"\n",
      "2. **Conquer**: Apply the DFT to each butterfly, using a smaller DFT size.\n",
      "3. **Combine**: Combine the results from each butterfly to form the final DFT.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FFT algorithm uses a combination of twiddle factors, which are complex exponentials, to efficiently compute the DFT. The most common FFT algorithms are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cooley-Tukey Algorithm**: This is the most widely used FFT algorithm, which uses a divide-and-conquer approach.\n",
      "2. **Radix-2 FFT**: This is a variation of the Cooley-Tukey algorithm, which uses a radix-2 (base-2) decomposition.\n",
      "3. **Bluestein's Algorithm**: This is a FFT algorithm that uses a convolution-based approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Advantages of the FFT**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Efficient**: The FFT algorithm is much faster than the naive DFT algorithm, with a computational complexity of O(n log n).\n",
      "2. **Accurate**: The FFT algorithm is highly accurate, with a small error bound.\n",
      "3. **Flexible**: The FFT algorithm can be used for a wide range of applications, from signal processing to scientific computing.\n",
      "\n",

Its applications are diverse, ranging from signal processing to scientific computing, and its advantages include efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility.\n"
